# Weekend Lab
Using your knowledge about Express and restful routing, write a blogging website.

It should be as simple as having a page that lists all blog posts as links to individual blog posts, a page to write (create) a post, a page for an individual blog post, a page to edit a blog post, etc. Use restful routing to structure your app!

Posts should have a title and a body. Use git to commit your changes whenever you make significant progress!

Some hints to get you started:

- Database called "blog"
- Table called "posts"
- `$ mkdir blog` (in `sf-wdi-14`), `$ npm init`, `$ npm install express` etc to get you started
- Restful routes
- Use [this repo](https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/contacts) as guide if there is something you don't remember (we coded this together last Thursday)

#AJAX HW

##Objective

* Make sure you understand what we did in class [today](https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/notes/blob/master/lectures/week-8/_1_monday/dawn/ajax-and-apis.md) first.
* Add single page functionality to the [library app](https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/library_spa)

##Specs

* Nest everything behind the `Library` variable. (Aka `Library.yourFunctName` is better than just having `yourFunctName` in the global namespace)
* On page load execute a function that retrives all the books and renders them onto a page.
* Add a delete button next to each book that deletes the associated book in the database and removes it from the list.
* BONUS: Add an input for a title and for an author and a submit button. Setup the button so that it will create a new book with the information in the input fields. Ensure the new book appears in your list of books without having to reload the page. 


##More
* Refer to the class [resource guide](https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/WDI-14-Online-Resource#json-apis--ajax) for more learning about AJAX & JSON APIs!

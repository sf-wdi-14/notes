## WDI 14 PROJECT 2 SPECS
For the second project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or others online. The type of web application you create is your choice: utilities, social networks, games, mashups, etc. Ensure however that the scope of your project is not too large so that you can reasonably complete a [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) in this time. 

The objective of this project is to:

* Get experience collaborating and working in a development team.
* Gain experience integrating topics covered during this course thus far.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.

## REQUIREMENTS
* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models with appropriate associations and validations.
* **Views.** Use **partials** heavily to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views, and loading data via Ajax when appropriate.
* **RSPEC** Write routing, controller, and model specs. Use [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to ensure your test coverage is greater than 75%. TDD implies you write the tests first! Otherwise it is a huge struggle to get them done. Be sure to impliment shoulda_matchers & FactoryGirl in your testing.
* **Validations & Error Messages.** Models in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. The full error messages should be displayed to the user above the form.
* **JavaScript & jQuery.** Spice up the front-end of your app with event driven functionality. Try out a new plugin or a library.
* **AJAX.** Use AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading the page when appropriate.
* **External APIs.** Use an external API to add functionality to your app.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have authentication and authorization set up.
* **Home page** - Don't forget to work on a proper homepage, clearly explaining what your app is and will do.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.
* **User Experience** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. It is suggested to use a front-end CSS framework like Bootstrap to enhance and ease your CSS styling. 


## OTHER IDEAS
If you want to push yourself further, consider adding some of the following to your app.

* **[Responsive Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)** Make sure your app looks decent on a phone or tablet.
* **File upload** Take a look at [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) or [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) using [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for file hosting.
* **Web Scraping** Check out [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/), [mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize), and [phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/).
* **Regex** You might consider using Regular Expressions to process text. Validation is one common use case. Use [Rubular](http://rubular.com/) for initial testing.
* **Charting** Visualize your data with [Morris.js](http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/) or [D3](http://d3js.org/).
* **Job Scheduling** Find a way to include Sidekiq (or Delayed Job or Resque) to your project.

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES


####Project Plan deliverables:
*You should review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.*

* **Group members.** You'll be working in groups of 3 or 4. Use your strengths to contribute to all parts of the project.
* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User stories.** What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in [Trello](https://trello.com).
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Schema** Draw out the models & their associations for your project.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.


####Completed Plan deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub
  * Must include a `README` with the following:
    * `Description`: A paragraph elevator pitch of your project
    * Another Link to Heroku hosted project
    * `Wireframes`
      * This is a good opportunity to map out what will require AJAX 
    * `User Stories`, `Site Flow`, or equivalent for MVP
    * A **schema**
    * APIs used
    * Scope 
    * Wishlist
    * Contributors
